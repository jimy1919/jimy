# 3D mapping tech on thin flims implementations
## Disney 
- the 3D show at the water fountain is cringy!  Even older than the Bellagio fountain show!
- With AH announce of 50Mil+ subscribers to DisneyPlus
  1. Bear
  The 50 million paid subscribers globally number includes free trials and Verizon customers who got it free. Of the 50M subscribers, 8M came from India. (On March 24, the service became available in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Spain and other European countries. And it launched in India on April 3, last week. These numbers would be higher given stay at home orders. This was just a well timed news release. Parks (36% of revenue) gone to zero/ negative because they are refunding season pass holders. Media networks is 34% of revenue led by the ESPN, which had no sports. And studios are another 15% of revenue, basically ground to a halt. 
  2. Bull
  DIS told investors last year it was hoping Disney+ would reach between 60 and 90 million subscribers worldwide by _2024_. Meanwhile, most analysts believed the service wouldnâ€™t hit 50 million subscribers until _2022_.


## Universal Studio 
- Much better than the Dis one, with the "deer" (sorry HarryPotter fans) showing vividly with quite a good submersive background
- Closed until ?
